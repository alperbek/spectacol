# Spectacol

Spectacol is a [free](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) ZX Spectrum emulator based on famous [FUSE spectrum emulator](http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/) but it uses its own UI made in QML.

Why QML? Well, first and foremost because I love Qt and I needed a framework which allows me to quickly target [lots of platforms](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/supported-platforms.html) painlessly.

# TODO write more info
